## **Revolutionizing Open-source with Multilingual Support - Focused on Kurdish Translations**

Welcome! We are excited to introduce you to a unique initiative that transcends boundaries and breaks language barriers in the realm of open-source projects. Our primary objective is to offer comprehensive translation services, predominantly focusing on Kurdish languages. Our venture is born out of a profound passion for open-source development and a staunch belief in promoting inclusivity and diversity in the tech world.

At its core, open-source is all about community participation and collaboration. We believe that language should not be an impediment to this. That’s why we've made it our mission to make open-source projects accessible to as many people as possible by providing high-quality translations. 

## **Supported dialects**

>      Kurmancî

>      Zazakî

## **Our Offerings**

Our team comprises linguistic experts proficient in Kurdish, backed with a thorough understanding of the technology landscape. We provide:

1. **Voluntary Translations for Open-Source Projects**: We work pro bono with open-source projects to support their growth and accessibility. We offer translations of technical documentation, user interfaces, and more to make these projects more accessible to Kurdish-speaking populations, promoting inclusivity and diversification.

2. **Paid Translations for Commercial Projects**: We also offer our translation services for commercial, proprietary projects. If your business is looking to expand into Kurdish speaking markets, we can help you adapt your software, applications, or platforms to meet these unique linguistic needs.

## **Why Choose Us?**

Our team understands the intricacies of both languages and the nuances of translating technical jargon into colloquial terms that the everyday user can comprehend. By choosing our services, you're not just getting a simple translation - you're getting a culturally nuanced, accurate reflection of your project in another language.

We work with a meticulous eye for detail to ensure that the meaning, tone, and intent of your original text are preserved. We strive to provide translations that resonate with the local populace, thus enhancing the potential reach and impact of your project.

## **Join Us in Our Mission**

We're excited about the potential of open-source and the value it brings to communities worldwide. We invite you to join us on this mission to make open-source projects more accessible to Kurdish-speaking communities. Together, we can bridge language gaps, promote cultural understanding, and contribute to the ongoing growth and diversification of the global open-source community.
